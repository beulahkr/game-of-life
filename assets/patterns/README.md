# Pattern Library

This directory contains predefined patterns for Conway's Game of Life.

## Built-in Patterns

The following patterns are built into the application:

### Oscillators
- **Blinker**: Simple 3-cell oscillator
- **Toad**: 4-cell oscillator
- **Beacon**: 4-cell oscillator
- **Pulsar**: Large 13x13 oscillator
- **Pentadecathlon**: Linear oscillator with period 15

### Spaceships
- **Glider**: Classic diagonal-moving spaceship

## Future Enhancements

This directory can be expanded to include:
- .rle (Run Length Encoded) pattern files
- .life pattern files
- JSON pattern definitions
- User-created patterns

Pattern files would be loaded dynamically to expand the available patterns beyond the built-in ones.
